       "\n",
       "1. **User Types**: What types of users will be using the application? (e.g., regular users, admins, moderators)\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Authentication Methods**: What authentication methods do you want to support? (e.g., email/password, social logins like Google/Facebook, multifactor authentication)\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Password Management**: Do you have any specific requirements for password complexity, expiration, or rules? Will you allow password resets, and if so, how?\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Session Management**: What kind of session management do you plan to implement? (e.g., session cookies, JWT tokens, OAuth tokens)\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Security Requirements**: Are there specific security standards or regulations that the authentication system must comply with? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **User Registration**: What information must be collected during user registration? Will email verification be required?\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **User Experience**: What kind of user experience do you want for sign-up and login? (e.g., one-click login, CAPTCHA, progressive disclosures)\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Technology Stack**: What technologies will be used for the front-end and back-end of your application? (e.g., JavaScript frameworks, backend languages, databases)\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **API Design**: Will the authentication system need to expose APIs for other services (like mobile apps), and if so, what endpoints are expected to be available?\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Account Recovery**: What processes will be in place for account recovery in case users forget their passwords?\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **Monitoring and Logging**: Is there a need for user activity monitoring, (e.g., login attempts, session management logs)? If so, what information should be logged?\n",
       "\n",
       "12. **Deployment Environment**: Where will the application be hosted (cloud, on-premises)? Any specific structural considerations?\n",
       "\n",
       "13. **Performance & Scalability**: Are there any specific performance or scalability requirements that should be taken into account?\n",
       "\n",
       "14. **User Data**: How will user data be stored, and are there any considerations for encryption (both in transit and at rest)?\n",
